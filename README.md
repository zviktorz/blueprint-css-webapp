# blueprint-css-webapp

( this is a copy of [blueprint-webapp](https://github.com/studio-templates/blueprint-webapp) converted to css in order to statically-deploy it)

This project includes a collection of [blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com) components for you to use, and for us to showcase the capabilities of Wix Component Studio.

Use this example to get a feel for how easy and fun it is to create and edit components in WCS that are based on 3rd party component libraries.

# Deployment
run `npx janet deploy` to update the deployed demo with the contents of your playground folder

In order to prevent overwriting our production demo, the janet.json file refers to `blueprint-css-webapp-test`

**if you want to update the live demo on our website**


Change `blueprint-css-webapp-test` -> `blueprint-css-webapp`


**Do this with caution**

## Getting Started

Install the latest version of the WCS desktop application to get started. Refer [here](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb32828) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

After installing the desktop application, have a look at [Cloning Projects](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb37629) to see how to clone a project from WCS. Use this URL for the repo to clone: **`https://github.com/studio-templates/blueprint-css-webapp/`**

Once youâ€™ve cloned the project, just run the installation script when prompted.  
(see [Running Project Scripts](https://component-studio.wixanswers.com/en/article/kb37621]), and the project will be ready for you to use after you restart WCS.
